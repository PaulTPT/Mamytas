ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* .gitignore
* README.markdown
* RESTful Android.iml
* docs\
* docs\android-developing-RESTful-android-apps.pdf
* docs\generate-javadoc.sh
* docs\javadoc-howto.txt
* docs\option-a.tiff
* docs\service-api-diagram.png
* lib\
* lib\scribe-1.2.3.jar
* proguard.cfg
* test\
* test\.classpath
* test\.project
* test\proguard.cfg
* test\project.properties

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
* assets\ => app\src\main\assets\
* res\ => app\src\main\res\
* src\ => app\src\main\java\
* test\res\ => app\src\androidTest\res\
* test\src\ => app\src\androidTest\java\

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

(This import summary is for your information only, and can be deleted
after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
